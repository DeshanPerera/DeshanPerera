## Hi! My name is [Deshan Perera](https://sites.google.com/view/deshanperera)

---
I am currently a Ph.D. (specialization in Bioinformatics) Candidate in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary, Canada supervised by Prof. Quan Long. 

My main research focus is on within-host evolution and pathogen genomics. Recently, my focus has expanded into within host evolution of cancer. My areas of expertise lie in understanding evolutionary dynamics within organisms and developing high-performance computational solutions to analyze these problems.
